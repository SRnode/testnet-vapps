## Developer

- **Experience**: Enthusiast developer exploring Web3 and zero-knowledge proofs. Have some experience with Python and Node.js projects.  

## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: zk-Content Proof  
- **Category**: social  

### Description
zk-Content Proof allows creators to prove authorship of digital content (articles, videos, code) without exposing personal metadata.  
Instead of sharing raw files or sensitive information, creators can submit a zero-knowledge proof that verifies their ownership and originality.  
This system helps protect creators from plagiarism and enables secure content verification for NFT-based or decentralized media platforms.  

### SL Integration
- Use Soundness Layer (SL) as the zk-proof verifier.  
- Content hashes (article, video, or code) are submitted, and SL validates zk-proof of authorship.  
- dApps and platforms can query SL contracts to verify originality and ownership before publishing or minting as NFTs.  
- SL SDK will handle proof generation and verification flows.  

## Technical

### Architecture
- Creator generates a hash of their content (text, video, code snippet).  
- zk-proof of authorship is created locally and submitted to SL.  
- SL smart contracts verify the proof.  
- Consumers/platforms validate authorship by querying SL.  

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React  
- **Backend**: Node.js / Python  
- **Blockchain**: SL + Ethereum (optional for NFT minting)  
- **Storage**: IPFS / WALRUS  

### Features
1. zk-proof of authorship for any digital content.  
2. Integration with NFT minting to bind authorship proof.  
3. Verification API for platforms to check originality.  

## Timeline

### PoC (2–4 weeks)
- [ ] Content hashing & proof generation  
- [ ] Basic SL integration  
- [ ] Simple creator dashboard  

### MVP (4–8 weeks)  
- [ ] Full NFT + content platform integration  
- [ ] Advanced proof verification  
- [ ] User testing with creators  

## Innovation
- First zk-based proof of content authorship for creators.  
- Protects intellectual property without leaking private data.  
- Bridges Web2 content creation with Web3 NFT ecosystems.  

## Contact
- Discord: h3oo  
- Updates will be shared on GitHub repo and Soundness Discord.
